Basics of computer graphics Fourth-Semester

Here I store and upload code written in C++. I'm using SFML, wxWidgets GUI and cimg libraries.

(Note: Not all of the projects have to work correctly. Some of them might be unfinished or have minor problems.
Alse the exercises might have already written code with place left to fill in order to finish certain tasks.)
