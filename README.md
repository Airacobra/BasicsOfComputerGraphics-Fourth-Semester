Basics of computer graphics Fourth-Semester

Here I store and upload code written using SFML and wxWidgets GUI library.

(Note: Not all of the projects have to work correctly. Some of them might be unfinished or have minor problems)
(Also some of the exercises had already written code with place left to finish certain tasks)
